# witcher-curriculum
 i am trying to make a curriculum web site from Geralt of Rivia, for fun and to learn and test new things. Always practicing!
 
nothing is optimized yet, I will compress the images as they are clearly too heavy (26MB!). I will make more commits soons

i haven't learned javascript yet, so the js code used on the slider was copied from the internet. otherwise, everything was done by me

## obviously the site was not finished
